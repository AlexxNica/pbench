* RPM making

There are four directories of interest here, meant for making RPMs. Each
contains a Makefile, a spec file, a seqno file, possibly some patches
and possibly a README.org. The general idea is that you invoke an rc
file of some sort (usually called "profile") which sets up PATH,
PYTHONPATH, CONFIG and then you cd into a subdirectory that contains
a Makefile and say =make=: that will create the RPMs and upload them
to the repo.

- pbench-agent: making a pbench-agent RPM.
- benchmarks: contains a subdirectory for each benchmark of interest.
- tools: contains a subdirectory for each tool of interest.
