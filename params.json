The first being the collection agent\r\nor harness, `pbench-agent`, responsible for providing commands for running\r\nbenchmarks across one or more systems, while properly collecting the\r\nconfiguration of those systems, their logs, and specified telemetry from\r\nvarious tools (`sar`, `vmstat`, `perf`, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe second sub-system included here is `bgtasks`, or \"back-ground tasks\",\r\nwhich is responsible for archiving result tar balls, indexing them, and\r\nunpacking them for display.\r\n\r\nThe third sub-system included here is the web server used to display various\r\ngraphs and results, and any other content generated by the background tasks,\r\nor by the `pbench-agent` during benchmark and tool post-processing steps.\r\n\r\n## How is it installed?\r\nInstructions on installing `pbench-agent`, and other components, can be found\r\nin the \"[How to\r\nInstall](http://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/pbench-agent.html#sec-5)\"\r\nsection of the [Getting Started\r\nGuide](http://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/pbench-agent.html).\r\n\r\nFor Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL users, we have made available [COPR\r\nbuilds](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/portante/pbench-agent/) for the\r\n`pbench-agent`.\r\n\r\n## How do I use pbench?\r\nRefer to this [Getting Started\r\nGuide](http://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/pbench-agent.html)\r\n\r\nTL;DR? See [Section\r\n4](distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/pbench-agent.html#sec-4) of the\r\n[Getting Started\r\nGuide](distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/pbench-agent.html) for a\r\nsuper quick set of introductory steps.\r\n\r\n## Where is the source kept?\r\nThe latest source code is at\r\nhttps://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench.\r\n\r\n## Is there a mailing list for discussions?\r\n\r\nYes, we use [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pbench)\r\n\r\n## Is there a place to track current and future work items?\r\nYes, we are using GitHub Issues and Pull Requests managed via\r\n[Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/distributed-system-analysis/pbench) for that.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
