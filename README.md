# Pbench [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/distributed-system-analysis/pbench.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/distributed-system-analysis/pbench)
A Benchmarking and Performance Analysis Framework

The code base includes three sub-systems. The first being the collection agent
or harness, `pbench-agent`, responsible for providing commands for running
benchmarks across one or more systems, while properly collecting the
configuration of those systems, their logs, and specified telemetry from
various tools (`sar`, `vmstat`, `perf`, etc.).

The second sub-system included here is `pbench-server`,
which is responsible for archiving result tar balls, indexing them, and
unpacking them for display.

The third sub-system included here is the web server used to display various
graphs and results, and any other content generated by the background tasks,
or by the `pbench-agent` during benchmark and tool post-processing steps.

## How is it installed?
Instructions on installing `pbench-agent`, can be found
in the "[PBench agent installation](http://ndokos.github.io/pbench/doc/doc/agent/installation.html)" guide.

For Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL users, we have made available [COPR
builds](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/ndokos/pbench/) for the
`pbench-agent`, `configtools`, `pbench-server`, `pbench-web-server`
and some benchmark and tool packages.

This assumes that somebody has already installed the server bits. The procedure
to do that is described in the "[PBench Server Installation](http://ndokos.github.io/pbench/doc/doc/server/installation.html)" guide.

## How do I use pbench?
Refer to this "[PBench User Guide](http://ndokos.github.io/pbench/doc/doc/agent/user-guide.html)".

TL;DR? See [TL;DR - How to set up pbench and run a benchmark

[PBench User
Guide](http://ndokos.github.io/pbench/doc/doc/agent/user-guide.html) for a
super quick set of introductory steps.
